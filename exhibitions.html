        <p class="article-text">
          Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky
          Above Us’, explores the night sky and what we can see and know about
          the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and
          galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators
          who used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar
          exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the
          latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

        <p class="article-text">
          For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
          question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
          here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
          framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
          Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
          know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet
          a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly
          Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
        <img src="images/IMG_9240.jpg" class="article-image" alt="" />
        <p class="article-text">
          From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology
          are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny
          world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their
          quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
          understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the
          history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs
          including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
          Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the
          lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow
          creatures have beat us to it.

        <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
        <img src="images/IMG_9253.jpg" class="article-image" alt="" />
        <p class="article-text">
          The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial
          intelligence are the science of the future. From useful home
          applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here.
          You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <img src="images/people-219985_1280.jpg" class="article-image" alt="" />
        <p class="article-text">
          As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
          planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
          create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
          planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we
          currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and
          pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all
          contribute to a brighter future.
