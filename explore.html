          Come on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can
          learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
          back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are
          designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come
          ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars club which
          meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll
          get to explore and experiment with our team of experts. During the
          school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other
          children your age to go on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we
          pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club
          and how you can join, send us a message.

          As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to create
          places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to give your
          students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our learning
          laboratory, and provide great video presentations that will excite and
          inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to find out more about
          our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through
          for a visit.
